# Conecta-4
##Made by Bender.dll

### Description.
This is a simple _Connect Four_ made in Java 21 by me.

Im a student of Java so this maybe is not the best way to do it.
If you download this source and test it, i hope you can enjoy it

##Usage: 

First of all you need to download the repository or the **conecta4.java**.
**_To download the repository do :_**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Benderdll/Conecta-4.git
```
Now go to the folder where do you downloaded and compile the **.java**
```bash
javac conecta4.java
```

Now, in the folder you should see a file named **_conecta4.class_**

That's the file that can run the game. To run the game do :
```bash
java conecta4
```
####Enjoy!
